# Introduction to the CPP Modules

The **CPP Modules** from `cpp00` to `cpp09` took us on a comprehensive journey through the foundational and advanced concepts of C++ programming. Throughout these modules, we started with the basics of syntax and gradually built up to more sophisticated topics such as object-oriented programming, memory management, and advanced algorithms. Each module introduced us to a new layer of complexity, ensuring that by the end of the series, we had a solid grasp of the essential C++ features and the best practices to employ while using that programming language.

We began by learning the essentials of **class design**, **memory allocation**, and **operator overloading**, and as we progressed, we dived deeper into topics like **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **templates**, and **type casting**. We also explored how to handle **exception safety**, worked with **abstract classes** and **interfaces**, and learned how to leverage the **Standard Template Library (STL)** to manage data efficiently. In the final modules, we tackled **algorithms**, **data structures**, and **performance optimization**, which gave us the skills to solve complex problems with C++.

By the end of this journey, we had developed a strong understanding of C++'s power and flexibility, enabling us to write clean, efficient, and scalable code.

## cpp00: Introduction to C++

- **Key Concepts:** Basics of C++ syntax, file structure, and compilation. Introduction to classes, member functions, and namespaces.
- **Focus:** Learning about the structure of a simple program, file inclusion, and command-line input.

## cpp01: Memory Allocation and References

- **Key Concepts:** Dynamic memory management, pointers, and references. Differences between stack and heap memory. Use of constructors and destructors.
- **Focus:** Managing memory manually and understanding the lifecycle of objects.

## cpp02: Overloading Operators

- **Key Concepts:** Operator overloading, copy constructors, and assignment operators. Introduction to the concept of fixed-point numbers.
- **Focus:** Implementing custom behavior for operators to make objects interact naturally with C++ syntax.

## cpp03: Inheritance and Polymorphism

- **Key Concepts:** Introduction to inheritance and polymorphism. Working with base and derived classes, virtual functions, and overriding.
- **Focus:** Building more complex class hierarchies, introducing flexibility with polymorphism.

## cpp04: Abstract Classes and Interfaces

- **Key Concepts:** Abstract classes, pure virtual functions, and interfaces. Deep dive into polymorphism with abstract base classes.
- **Focus:** Designing more sophisticated systems with abstract concepts and exploring how C++ handles class design.

## cpp05: Exception Handling and Form Management

- **Key Concepts:** Introduction to exception handling (`try`, `catch`, `throw`), and working with bureaucratic forms. Exploring how exceptions can be used to manage errors.
- **Focus:** Handling errors gracefully in more complex systems involving form processing.

## cpp06: Type Casting

- **Key Concepts:** Type casting in C++, including dynamic, static, and reinterpret casts. Converting data between types, and handling conversions safely.
- **Focus:** Implementing systems that rely on different types, converting between them without causing undefined behavior.

## cpp07: Templates

- **Key Concepts:** Template programming, including function templates, class templates, and template specialization. Iterators and arrays are explored through templates.
- **Focus:** Writing generic code that can handle different data types without duplication.

## cpp08: Containers and Algorithms

- **Key Concepts:** Standard Template Library (STL) containers, iterators, and algorithms. Working with common data structures such as vectors, lists, and stacks.
- **Focus:** Efficient data management using the STL and understanding how algorithms interact with containers.

## cpp09: Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures

- **Key Concepts:** Exploring more advanced algorithms and data structures, including sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort) and the reverse Polish notation (RPN). Working with non-linear data structures.
- **Focus:** Building more advanced systems with an emphasis on performance and complexity.
